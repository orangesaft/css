Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes and choose the public option instead of the default private.

Clone that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).

Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)



When youâ€™re building your project, you will probably end up doing several git add + git commit cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git push origin main.
